This chatbot was developed for the Ukrainian branch of the non-profit organization United World Colleges (UWC). UWC is a global movement that harnesses the power of education to bring people, nations, and cultures together for peace and a sustainable future. The purpose of this bot is to streamline communication with UWC alumni and enhance the organization of numerous volunteer projects conducted by UWC.

Bot is built upon TelegramAPI (a social messanger used by the majority of alumni), using SQLite to manage database.
